# Rat In a Maze

Project has been made to demonstrate data structures and backtracking with Javascript as a framework. Application has been built with React.

The project is to demonstate the logic behind a rat getting from a source to a destination. The rat can only move down and right. It cannot move left or upwards. If a solution in one direction is not found, it can backtrack the path and find an alternative route.

Due to the random generation of the maze a solution is not always viable.

### Assumptions:

- The Rat **Source** is **always** at 0,0 in terms of the grid.
- The **Destination** is **always** at n,n eg: If the grid is 5x5, then it will be at position 5,5.

## Technologies used

Built with:

- HTML
- JS
- CSS
- Reactjs

## Setup and usage

**NB: The maze generation is random and as a result, the maze does not always have a solution! Keep trying!**

### Assumptions:

- The Rat **Source** is **always** at 0,0 in terms of the grid.
- The **Destination** is **always** at n,n eg: If the grid is 5x5, then it will be at position 5,5.
