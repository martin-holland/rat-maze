# Rat in a Maze

## Assumptions:

- The Rat **Source** is **always** at 0,0 in terms of the grid.
- The **Destination** is **always** at n,n eg: If the grid is 5x5, then it will be at position 5,5.

## To do next:

- pass data from generated maze into rows to colorize the individual cells, showing either a pass or a block.
